A vanilla JavaScript template. 
This is a work in progress that seeks to
use a simple MVC pattern that reacts to events 
by running qualified methods of the controller object. 
A few demo actions are included as examples. 

Except for Lea Verou's prefixfree library which adds
two objects on the global scope (the window object),
this template adds only 4 more: 

L, a small personal js library;

m, the model, which holds state variables; 

v, the view, which holds references to all
 elements and objects that have id properties; 
c, the controller, which holds all the methods
for the app.
